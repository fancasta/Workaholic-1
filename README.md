<h5>Summer Vacation Web Development Project by:</h5><p>Chin Hock Yang and Nguyen An Khanh</p>

<h5>Motivation:</h5>
<p>
When assigned a project, it is important for a student to be clear of the project deliveries and deadlines. Having a detailed plan will allow the student to pace himself towards the completion of the project. However as the number of deadlines increases due to the accumulation of workload across modules, many students feel overwhelmed and often struggle to make an organised plan for their projects. Without a clear direction to work towards, students end up wasting time and efforts on insignificant tasks. This often leads to a poorly-paced project, where students have to “rush” to put together an unproductive last-minute work to meet deadlines. Furthermore, when working in group projects, miscommunication often exists due to lack of group meetings, or due to important messages “buried”  in project group chats. This results in group members being unaware of their taskings, as well as the important project timeline and goals.
</p>

<h5>Aim:</h5>
<p>
We hope to provide a platform for one to plan and manage important deadlines and to-dos of his projects. 
We also aim to improve group communication and teamwork, so that group members can easily access important project information and updates of their projects.
</p>

<h5>Target User:</h5>
<p>
Anyone working in any form of individual or group projects. While the source of our motivation is students, our platform can also be utilised by other professionals who are also working in courseworks or projects.
